# Assessment

## Introduction
As part of the application process for the job position Data Scientist an assessment is taken. In this assessment you are asked to develop and present a case to the team. This document will explain the case you need to work on.
We expect you to develop this assessment in Python, but with the right reasoning we will also accept other languages. Our department uses Python as their main development language.

## Case description
For this case we use a dataset of a company which has committed fraud in the past. 
You are requested to build a model that predicts persons of interest within the company or perform a data analysis and tell a story about the data.

## Data
The dataset contains a list of employees and features containing salary, secondary benefits and email message data. The data contains a lot of missing values.

We have created a basic module structure to get you started quickly.

```
import assessment
persons_of_interest = assessment.preprocessing.read_persons_of_interest()
```

## Evaluation

We expect you to spend around 1 to 1.5 hours on this assessment. We don't expect a full solution but instead are interested more in your thought patterns and your approach.

Your solution will be evaluated with respect to the following key points:

- Understanding of the problem
- The process you followed and experiment design (data processing, model selection, etc)
- Coding style
- The way you present your outcomes
